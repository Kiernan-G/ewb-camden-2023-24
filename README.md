Using python3 venv environment, might have to install on raspberry pi to get working
'python3 -m venv env'

Unix has a way to run scripts automatically with a cron job and creating a new systemd service. Can use this to reboot once a day and make sure everything is running properly. Also want proper consideration for extraneous situations, such as if the hardware gets knocked over by a bad storm or something.
